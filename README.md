# Poker
**Useful Poker methods to ultimately build a high performing poker bot**

In this repository I will be writing various Python scripts related to poker with the ultimate goal of putting it all together to create a state of the art poker AI that can actively adapt and exploit opponents in a multi handed Texas NLHE game. 
A lot of the more common functionalities (hand evaluator, equity estimator, hand reading, etc) will be public.
